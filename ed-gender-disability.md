# Gender Critical feminists see being female as a disability.

[**Note: My views have changed. This is old work. Take it with a grain of salt.**]

They see gender as an oppressive hierarchy, constructed by Patriarchy to "other" and to subjugate women. Gender is a prison; they seek to abolish the prison to liberate women. Patriarchy's narrative of "innate gender," to them, is a shackle to a prison cell.

Trans lives reinforce the idea of innate gender. That's why they're so opposed to us.

Since gender is a prison, all things feminine are weak, submissive, traps to ensnare us into subservience. GCs support the "butch," but not the "femme." GCs don't like lipstick!

Being female is a disability, because it means being shackled to the lesser, feminine gender role.

So why would trans women want to transition? Who would give themself a disability?

GCs think Gender Dysphoria (GD) is very similar to Body Integrity Identity Disorder (BIID.) BIID sufferers, so-called "transabled" people, have dysphoria about being able-bodied. People with BIID often take extreme measures to disable themselves, mutilating their limbs or paralyzing themselves. Many GCs see physical transition as physically disabling oneself, BIID-style.

A subgroup of BIID sufferers, in addition to body dysphoria, report feeling "social dysphoria." They'll wear casts, go out in public in wheelchairs, so that they're treated as physically disabled people. To GCs, living as a woman is akin to the BIID kind of social dysphoria - pretending to have the disability of female gender.

GCs see a parallel between GD and BIID because they view being female is just another kind of disability to be acquired through BIID.

You can see the parallel in action in their minds:

Many people in the queer community enjoy playing with gender. Many of us are gender abolitionists, but that doesn't mean we can't have fun screwing around with the societal lens of gender, does it?
GCs are appalled by this. I think they see it as playing around, "pretending" to have this disability of theirs. I think their utopia would be totally masculine.

Much of the hate from GC radfems towards trans women sounds very misogynistic: body shaming, telling us to be submissive, chastising us for "wanting to feel girly."
Since being feminine is a disability, wanting to be feminine is appropriative of being truly disabled. So they respond the same way.

I don't think being female is a disability. Women are disadvantaged by patriarchy, but there's more to being female than simply being disadvantaged. And masculine isn't inherently better than feminine.
