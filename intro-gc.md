# Intro to Gender Critical Feminism

Gender Critical feminism is exactly what it says - critical of gender.

Natal males are physically stronger and more powerful than natal females. The natal male body is capable of oppression, subjugation, rape. The male sex was capable of subduing the female sex. It was necessary for natal males to control and suppress natal females. This became Patriarchy.

Natal males shaped society around themselves. Their behavior, expectations and societal roles - all things masculine - became the default. The natal female body was labeled *in opposition* to the natal male body. Female behavior, the role of natal females in society, their expression - all things feminine - were defined *in contrast* to masculinity. Femininity was constructed to be lesser than masculinity.

The sum total of feminine expression and behavior, the sex role of natal females in society, became the female gender. Since femininity was constructed in opposition to, and subservient to, masculinity, the female gender is by construction lesser than the male gender.

Patriarchy survives by teaching the narrative that gender is innate, that natal females *naturally* have this female gender identity, and natal males *naturally* have this male gender identity.

Social constructs survive through *socialization* and *recreation*. Patriarchy, as a social construct, survives by socializing natal females into the female gender identity, and natal males into the male gender identity.  Male gender perforance polices the sex role of natal females, governs their behavior, and recreates the female gender. Female gender performance recreates the feminine in every social interaction and every behavior, constantly redefining itself as lesser and subservient to the male gender.

Natal females enter the world as blank slates, but are socialized into becoming women. Growing up in a Patriarchal society, natal females are taught by their parents, their communities and their social interactions about supposed "innate" or "natural" ways they should act, dress, behave and talk to Men. Wherever they don't conform to that gender, they're punished. When they *do* conform, they are rewarded - just less so than natal males. As they grow older, they take an active role in further socializing *themselves* into femininity.

By believing the narrative of innate gender identity, natal females become complicit in their own imprisonment!

Gender is an oppressive hierarchy, used to imprison and exploit natal females by natal males. Gender Critical feminism seeks to liberate natal females from this prison.
