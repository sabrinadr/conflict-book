# Who Becomes Gender Critical?

*(Note to trans/trans ally readers!* ***DO NOT IGNORE THIS SECTION!*** *)*

Former allies.

No, seriously.

Think about it. Most Gender Critical feminists started out as feminists. The prevailing consensus in liberal feminism (libfem) is transfeminism. Most GCs started out as allies to the trans community, since they started out as libfems.

There seem to be at least three major avenues towards Gender Critical Feminism:

1. Disturbing or threatening behavior of trans natal males towards natal females, or a perceived absurdity in the trans narrative, triggers a "Peak Trans" moment, which causes feminists to start questioning the trans narrative.
2. Starting to feel like the reification of innate gender by Transfeminism was a step back from decades of feminist progress, which causes feminists to start questioning the existence of gender.
3. Harsh callouts or being kicked out of the feminist community for questioning the trans narrative, which makes GCs feel silenced.

There are probably many more Gender Critical feminists than a Transfeminist would imagine exist. It's a pretty underground community because dissent is punished.
