# Terminology

* **Natal males/natal females:** our binary sex. Not used interchangably with men and women, see "Gender" below.
* **Gender:** the socially constructed identities of "man" and "woman" from natal males and natal females, which feel as real as money.
* **Socialization:** how we fashion ourselves into men and women from natal males and natal females, and how we are taught/coerced to do so. (de Beauvoir.)
* **Gendered society:** at a societal level, how male and female seem as "real" as money.
* **Patriarchy:** the power hierarchy of men over women, policing and protecting the tangibility of gendered society and gender identities.
* **Lens of gender / gender color:** our perception of ourselves and each other as "men" and "women," and of the world as "masculine" and "feminine." What makes gender seem as real and tangible as money. How gender colors worldviews.
* **Gender performance:** the constant process of reproducing ours and others' identities as "men" and "women." We perform gender by seeing ourselves as men and women, and seeing each other as men and women, through the lens of gender. (Butler.)
* **Gender identity:** our perception of ourselves as men and women, through our own lens of gender. Partly immutably constructed during socialization, partly how we relate to our bodies and ourselves through the lens. Everyone has a gender, the same way everyone has or hasn't money.
* **Men:** people with the gender identity of "man", by socialization and by self-perception. Men exercise power over women through patriarchy.
* **Women:** people with the gender identity of "woman," by socialization and self-perception. Women are victimized by men through patriarchy.
* **Innate gender:** the conservative narrative that gender identity is innate, even if it's not fully determined by natal sex.
* **Gender abolitionism:** the political goal of radical feminism, abolishing the constructs of men and women. Akin to the anarchist goal of abolishing the construct of money.
* **Non-binary gender:** perceiving your gender identity as being neither male nor female.
* **Transgender:** people whose gender identity is not aligned with their biological sex. Gender abolitionists and GCs can be transgender, the same way anarchists can be (and often are!) broke.
* **Gender dysphoria:** social dysphoria from being transgender, OR body dysphoria from wanting primary/secondary sexual characteristics of the opposite natal sex.
* **Gender critical:** the belief that innate gender is a false narrative, as well as the political goals of gender abolitionism, and of organizing feminism around natal females.
* **Transfeminism:** the belief that innate gender is real, as well as the political goals of recognizing innate gender as separate from sex, and of organizing feminism around both natal females and transgender natal males.
* **Transgender activist:** an activist supporting the needs and/or the political objectives of transgender people.
