# Intro to Transfeminism

Transfeminism accepts transgender people into feminism. It seeks to destroy the gender *hierarchy,* but not necessarily gender itself.

Some transfeminists are *gender abolitionists*, seeking to destroy the social construct of gender, and don't see gender as innate. Others seek *gender equality*, and believe that gender *is* innate, but that all genders should be equal.

Patriarchy exists to subjugate people with the female gender identity and empower people with the male gender identity. However, to abolish Patriarchy, only the *hierarchy* must be abolished, *not* gender itself!

Gender Criticals see gender as just a marker, a kind of scarlet letter inscribed on female bodies by Patriarchy. Men are socialized to treat "F" marked bodies as property, as submissive, as sexual objects. To a Gender Critical, that marker is all there is to gender, since it isn't innate and was constructed fundamentally to be unequal.

But Gender Criticals ignore ***gender expression.*** Because of Patriarchy, gender has *become* a marker labeling women for misogyny and men for privilege. But *expressing your gender* through clothing, makeup, pronouns and body characteristics doesn't inherently *justify* Patriarchy. You should be free to express your gender. We should fight Patriarchy by fighting misogyny and privilege, not by fighting the marker itself! Abolishing gender to fight Patriarchy is like fighting racism by bleaching everyone's skin white.

Gender Criticals think if an "innate gender identity" existed, it would *justify* the scarlet letter. Having innate gender would mean that intrinsically, women are *naturally* submissive, *naturally* property to be carefully guarded, *naturally* sexual objects.

But that's **bullshit!** Gender Criticals have fallen into the trap of believing masculine gender traits really *are* the default, and feminine traits really *should* be othered!

Rather than seeing gender as a limitation or a prison, Transfeminists see gender as *freedom.* Keeping that freedom means fighting Patriarchy by fighting misogyny and male privilege, not our own right to fearlessly define and express our gender, and be treated as equals regardless!

# Identity Politics
