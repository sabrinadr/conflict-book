# Introduction

Cracks are forming in feminism along the fault line of gender identity. Most of feminism has embraced trans women as women, trans men as men, and non-binary people as something else entirely, and included all of us. The trans narrative has gone mainstream. An earthquake is due.

# Who are the sides?

On the left, we have Transfeminists! On the right, we have Gender Critical Feminists! (Metaphorical left and right; both sides are actually *pretty* progressive, with their fair share of anarchists!)

## Transfeminism
Transfeminism accepts the trans narrative into feminism, and accepts trans people into the feminist tent. Gender is a core component of identity. Gender identity is innate, but separate from sex. Feminism is the struggle of natal females and trans natal males to dismantle Patriarchy, abolish coercive gendering and make all genders equal.

Trans women *are* included, since they have female gender identity, and are alienated from Patriarchy.

## Gender Critical Feminism
Gender Critical feminism *doesn't* accept the trans narrative. Feminism is the class struggle between natal males and natal females, by liberating natal females from gender.

Trans natal males *aren't* included, since they aren't part of the oppressed class of natal females, and have male privilege.

# Why are we fighting?
Gender critical feminism and Transfeminism have conflicting visions about the purpose of feminism, and who should be included. That created a wedge between two irreconcilable feminisms.

No-platforming and harsh callouts drove fear into Gender Critical natal females, who felt silenced. Scary examples of problematic and disturbing behavior by trans natal males further polarized the Gender Critical community. Scary examples of Gender Critical activism, such as Cathy Brennan's website [Gender Identity Watch](https://genderidentitywatch.com/), and continued struggles for facility access etc., drove fear into the trans community and polarized it. At this point, both sides have become self-radicalizing, and the problem is getting worse.
