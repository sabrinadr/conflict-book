# Introduction

Cracks are forming in feminism along the fault line of gender identity. Most of feminism has embraced trans women as women, trans men as men, and non-binary people as something else entirely, and included all of us. The trans narrative has gone mainstream. This is causing quite a bit of heartburn.

# Who are the sides?

On the left, we have Transfeminists! On the right, we have Gender Critical Feminists! (Metaphorical left and right; both sides are actually *pretty* progressive, with their fair share of anarchists!)

## Transfeminism
Transfeminism accepts the trans narrative into feminism, and accepts trans people into the feminist tent. Gender is a core component of identity. Gender identity is innate, but separate from sex. Feminism is the struggle of natal females and trans natal males to dismantle Patriarchy, abolish coercive gendering and make all genders equal.

Trans women are included, since they have female gender identity.

## Gender Critical Feminism
Gender Critical feminism *doesn't* accept the trans narrative. Feminism is the class struggle between natal males and natal females, by liberating natal females from gender.

Trans natal males *aren't* included, since they aren't part of the oppressed class of natal females.
