# Preface

# Warning!

This book is filled with "TERF" heresy. If you're trans, and afraid of TERFs (and you have good reasons to be - Gender Critical feminism is kind of an existential threat!) You might want to steer clear. This book isn't a safe space.

Make sure you take breaks if you're feeling overwhelmed, and give yourself some mental space. Talking to a friend helps (hell, talk to me!)

# Note on Terminology

Transfeminists and Gender Critical feminists use very different language. Understanding the other side requires hiring a translator. To make this zine accessible to both sides, I'm going to use a hodge-podge. Both sides will see many of these terms as problematic, but hopefully they're at least clear.

Note that I'm using "is" vs. "sees", "true" vs. "believes" etc. throughout much of the book, to describe both sides. Mostly to keep my typing fingers from wearing out.

* "Natal male" and "natal female" replace AMAB and AFAB.
* "Gender Critical" replaces "TERF." 
* GC refers to "Gender Critical."
* TF refers to "Transfeminism."

# What's the purpose?

I want us to understand what we're fighting about! Each side has *such a* poor picture of the other. I'm trying to just *describe* the conflict that's going on, rather than taking a side here.

# Why?

* Most GCs started out as allies of the trans community.
* Most trans allies right now are newcomers.
* There's a potential for a huge swing towards GC, and a lot of conflict.

# Are you a TERF?

I'm trans! I don't hate myself *nearly enough* to believe my entire existence is problematic. I'm just trying to like, negotiate and translate, build a bridge of understanding. I'm not taking sides, *as much as I can.*

Personally, I want to take the best of both worlds, if that's possible. I want to fight for my survival and acceptance, but I also want natal females to have their own spaces to advocate for *their rights,* unimpeded by those who don't have skin in that game. I believe those objectives don't need to be at odds with each other.
